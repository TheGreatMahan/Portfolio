        <h2>Why Batman?</h2>
        <p>The reason I chose Batman is because I am really interested in him because of the hard path he had 
        before he became so powerful and useful to his city. In the beginning he as a billionair child and a person
        had everything, lost his parents and steped into the world of depression. This was a great loss for Bruce Wayne.
        This accident made the life, a living hell for him. The best thing he could do, was to just try to get drunk and 
        become a useless billionair who only drinks and enjoys the pleasures of this world. Instead, he went to find-out who killed his parents instead of leaning on the corrupted police
        of Gotham. Even after finding the murdrer, he didn't kill him and forgave the killer. This shows what a great personality he actually has.</p>
        
        <p>He afterwards, finds lots of enemies. Watching the movies and reading the comics will show you what a great personality he has
            . The only issue that I have with Batman, is the fact that he doesn't kill, even if they are the worst people you have ever seen.
            He should have killed the Joker a long time ago. But he doesn't go on that road.
        </p>

        <h2>Becoming the dark knight</h2>
        <p>After a couple of years that passed of his parent death, he went to train with Ra's Algul who was the leader of
        the league of assassins. Ra's Algul taught him the martial arts and many other things. After leaving the league of assassins,
        he went back to Gotham in order bring justice to criminals to be able to save his city. His fear over bats, made him name himself 
        Batman.
